# Version 2
## Description
In this version, I implemented several new endpoints, along with CSS styling, and dynamic HTML generation for the contact log.

The contact form now updates the contact log.

Is the image on the front page getting longer, or is it just me?

## How to run
This version can be ran in a few simple steps:

- Ensure you have a recent version of Python on your computer
- Clone this repo and open a terminal in the <code>v2</code> directory
- Run this command: <code>python3 server.py</code>
- Open <code>http://localhost:4131/</code> in your local browser
