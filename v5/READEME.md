# Version 5
## Change Log
1. Server ported from Python to Express.js!!!
    - Why didn't I start here? Great question

2. **ALL HTML** replaced with **Pug**
    - Pug, formerly known as Jade, is a concise and elegant templating language for generating HTML. It makes writing HTML more efficient by using indentation-based syntax rather than explicit closing tags. With its simplicity and powerful features like mixins and inheritance, Pug streamlines the process of creating dynamic web content.
